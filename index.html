			<p class="text">My name is Aamir Laasi.</p> 
			<p class="text">I am currently living in Houston. I was born in Pakistan, moved to Sri Lanka when I was nine years old, and then eventually settled in the U.S.A when I was fifteen. As you can tell, I am a proponent of the oxford comma. </p>
			<p class="text">I attended the University of Texas at Austin and studied chemical engineering. After I graduated, I moved to the city of Houston.</p>
			<p class="text">I started working as a Process Engineer when I moved to Houston and I have been doing that for the past eleven years. </p>
			<p class="text">I was one of the co-founders of a start-up called Sohmiume that I worked on part-time. Our goal was to develop a process for the mass manufacture of carbon nanotubes. Unfortunately, though we were able to develop a prototype we were not able to raise any outside funding for the venture. Remember, always have a clear value proposition!</p>
			<p class="text">One of my hobbies is to read a lot of fantasy fiction. One of my favorite books is "The Name of the Wind". If you haven't read it then you should! However, be warned that this book is part of a trilogy and there still isn't a release date set for the last book.</p>
